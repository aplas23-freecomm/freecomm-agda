# Agda Development of Free Algebraic Structures using Freshlists

Developed with Agda version 2.6.3.

We used a development version of the Agda standard library, commit ref 7c5f3ff90fa7ff1b9d4a522050291119f209a85b.
(The most recent at the time of submission).

Type-check the file `src/Everything.agda` to have Agda check all of our results.

See the file `src/Index.agda` for the results which correspond to each definition and proposition in the paper *A Fresh Look at Commutativity: Free Algebraic Structures via Fresh Lists*.
